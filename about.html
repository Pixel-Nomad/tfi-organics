All kinds of salt, all hours of the day, that level of obsession is built into our culture of continuous improvement. From working with our harvesting partners to improve annual salt yields, to identifying a process to “grow” a grain size for a new line of natural bath salts, our team obsesses about doing things better, faster and with more passion than any other ingredient supplier you’ll meet. And while it doesn’t mean we’ve never run “out-of-stock” or made mistakes along the way, but it does mean that we will do our best to build your trust and earn your business day in and day out. We will commit to continuously getting better at our craft every day and surround ourselves with peers, colleagues and customers committed to the same. We work tirelessly to innovate for superior quality using superior technology and modern supply chain efforts. 
                    We take immense pride in the quality of our products. Each batch of Himalayan salt undergoes rigorous testing and strict quality control measures to ensure that it meets and exceeds international standards.

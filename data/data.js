Edible Salt: </strong><br><br>Edible salt, also known as table salt or common salt, is the most widely used type of salt in households and food processing. It is primarily composed of sodium chloride (NaCl) and is obtained from salt mines or through the evaporation of seawater. Edible salt is used not only for seasoning and preserving food but also plays a crucial role in various biological processes within the human body. Its fine granular texture and white color make it easily recognizable. Edible salt is available in various forms, including iodized salt, which is fortified with iodine to prevent iodine deficiency disorders. It is an essential ingredient in culinary practices worldwide.<br><br><strong>2. Black Salt:</strong><br><br>Black salt, also known as Kala Namak, is a type of rock salt primarily found in the Himalayan regions of South Asia. Unlike its name suggests, black salt is not black but rather pinkish-grey in color and has a distinct sulfurous aroma due to its sulfur content. It is used extensively in South Asian cuisines, especially in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, to add a unique flavor to various dishes. Black salt is believed to aid digestion and is often used in traditional Ayurvedic medicine for its purported health benefits. It can be found in both coarse and fine varieties and is commonly used to season chaats, chutneys, and savory snacks."

Himalayan pink salt is believed to be one of the purest forms of salt available, containing fewer pollutants compared to other types of salt. It is commonly used both in cooking and as a decorative element, such as in salt lamps and spa treatments. Proponents of Himalayan pink salt claim that it offers various health benefits, although scientific evidence supporting these claims is limited."
